## 1. Overview
The QIP-X Framework is a cutting-edge quantum-integrated AI system combining:
- **Quantum-Ascendant Cryptography (QAC):** Uses quantum entropy and adaptive chaotic maps to generate unbreakable keys.
- **Chrono-Intelligence Engine (CIE):** Implements quantum-assisted simulated annealing for multiversal timeline optimization.
- **Hyper-Chaotic Neural Networks (HCNN):** Self-healing, deep AI models with dynamic activation switching.

## 2. Architecture

### Components:
- **License Verification Module:** Ensures authorized usage.
- **Quantum Entropy Generation:** Supports both single and multi-qubit configurations.
- **Adaptive Chaotic Transformation:** Applies a logistic map with bias correction.
- **Quantum-Assisted Simulated Annealing:** Optimizes objective functions with QRNG.
- **Deep Neural Networks:** Employ dynamic activations for self-healing training.

## 3. Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Docker (recommended for deployment)
- Python 3.9+
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Local Setup (Without Docker):
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 4. Deployment

For containerized deployment, use the provided `Dockerfile` and `deploy.sh` script:
1. Build the image:
    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
2. The container will run on port 8080 (configurable in the Dockerfile).

## 5. Usage

- **License Verification:**  
  The system automatically verifies authorized usage based on the MD5 hash of the developer's name.

- **Core Functions:**  
  - **generate_quantum_entropy:** Generates quantum entropy.
  - **enhanced_chaotic_map:** Derives a secure key.
  - **chrono_optimization:** Optimizes timeline parameters.
  - **DeepHCNN & train_hcnn:** Train and evaluate the deep neural network.

Refer to inline documentation in the source code for API details.

## 6. Performance Analytics

The system integrates advanced performance analytics modules to:
- Monitor key generation timings.
- Track convergence in simulated annealing.
- Log neural network training metrics.
- Aggregate statistical performance data for further optimization.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **License Errors:**  
  Verify that the correct developer name is provided to `verify_license()`.
  
- **Quantum Hardware Issues:**  
  If using hardware (`use_hardware=True`), ensure IBMQ credentials are valid and network connectivity is stable.

- **Performance Degradation:**  
  Use provided logging and analytics to determine which module (QAC, CIE, or HCNN) may require parameter adjustments.
